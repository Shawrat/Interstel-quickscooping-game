# Interstel-quickscooping-game
Right from the beginning of our (i.e, me and me alone) journey in the creation of this game, our goal was to give a game that would elicit some kind of unexpressed extreme emotions in the minds of the audience. With keen passion and dedication, we are here now to present this game called interstel√© quickscooping which puts you directly into the shoes of a struggling astronaut.
